**Architecture:**

UniHub's architecture is designed to be modular, scalable, and highly maintainable, with each microservice responsible for a specific domain.

* **Gateway**: The API Gateway serves as the entry point for incoming requests, routing them to the appropriate microservices based on configured routes and filters.
* **Service Registry (service-reg)**: The Service Registry uses Eureka to manage the registration and discovery of microservices, enabling dynamic discovery and load balancing.
* **Product Microservice (productms)**: Responsible for managing product information, including creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving products.
* **Transaction Microservice (transactionms)**: Manages transaction information, including creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving transactions.
* **User Microservice (userms)**: Handles user management, including creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving user information.
