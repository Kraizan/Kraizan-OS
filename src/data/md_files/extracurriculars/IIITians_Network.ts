# My Experience with IIITians Network

My journey with the IIITians Network began in my first year when I was fortunate enough to be contacted by Anant Mehra, the founder of the network. He entrusted me with the exciting task of building the Discord server from scratchâ€”a responsibility I embraced wholeheartedly. This opportunity not only allowed me to contribute to the community but also laid the foundation for my growth within the organization.

## Junior Executive

I officially joined the IIITians Network as a Junior Executive in March 2022. In this role, I served as the Community Administrator for our Discord server, where I effectively managed and nurtured a vibrant community of over 700 members. My passion for connecting with fellow IIITians led me to organize multiple inter-IIIT events, including a thrilling 1v1 Knockout Competitive Programming Contest and engaging jamming sessions. Each event fostered camaraderie and collaboration among students from various institutes across India, and I was thrilled to see our community thrive.

## Senior Executive

As my commitment and contributions became evident, I was promoted to Senior Executive in December 2022. In this role, I took on more significant responsibilities, focusing on maintaining the Discord server to ensure healthy interactions among IIITians nationwide. I played a key role in promoting and conducting events that further enriched our community. 

After eight months of dedicated service as a Senior Executive, I felt an immense sense of fulfillment as I passed on my responsibilities to the upcoming juniors. It was rewarding to see the growth of the IIITians Network and to know that I had played a part in its success.

Reflecting on this journey, I am grateful for the experiences and connections I have made through the IIITians Network. It has been a remarkable chapter in my academic life, filled with learning, leadership, and lasting friendships.
