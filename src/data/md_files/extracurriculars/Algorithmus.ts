# My Involvement with Algorithmus (CP Club)

My journey with Algorithmus, the Competitive Programming (CP) Club at IIIT Kota, has been a significant part of my academic life from 2021 to 2023. As a Core Team Member, I was immersed in a vibrant environment dedicated to fostering coding skills and competitive spirit among students.

## Core Team Member

During my tenure, I had the opportunity to conduct various events and workshops focused on Competitive Programming and Data Structures and Algorithms. I covered essential topics such as C++ STL, Binary Search, sets, maps, and heaps, which are fundamental to mastering the art of coding. 

One of the highlights of my involvement was organizing the official coding contest for IIIT Kota, known as Endeavour, on VJudge. This event not only tested the skills of participants but also brought together passionate coders from our institution to compete and grow together.

In addition to organizing events, I took pride in mentoring students as they prepared for competitive programming contests on platforms like Codeforces and CodeChef. Guiding fellow students, sharing insights, and watching them improve and succeed was incredibly fulfilling.

Reflecting on my time with Algorithmus, I am grateful for the skills I developed, the friendships I formed, and the impact I was able to make in nurturing a community of aspiring programmers. It has been an enriching experience that I will carry with me as I continue my journey in the world of technology.
