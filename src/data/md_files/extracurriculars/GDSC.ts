# My Journey with Google Developer Student Clubs

As I reflect on my time with Google Developer Student Clubs (GDSC), I am filled with a sense of pride and accomplishment. My journey began in 2021 when I joined the Core Team of GDSC IIIT Kota as the Competitive Programming Lead. Little did I know that this would be the starting point of an incredible adventure that would shape my skills, leadership, and passion for technology.

## Empowering Students through Competitive Programming

As the Competitive Programming Lead, I was responsible for helping students prepare for contests like Codeforces and CodeChef. I conducted workshops on topics such as C++ STL, Binary Search, Hashing, and Heaps, which not only helped students improve their coding skills but also instilled in them a sense of confidence and competitiveness. Witnessing students grow and succeed in the world of competitive programming was truly rewarding, and I was proud to have played a part in their journey.

## Leading the Charge as GDSC Lead

Fast forward to 2022, I was given the opportunity to take on a new challenge as the Lead of GDSC IIIT Kota. With a team of 8 dedicated members, we worked tirelessly to organize various events and workshops throughout the year. We conducted workshops on cutting-edge technologies like Flutter, Firebase, and Google Cloud Platform, which not only helped students stay up-to-date with industry trends but also provided them with hands-on experience.

## Mentoring and Guiding

As the Lead, I also had the privilege of mentoring students and guiding them in their projects and hackathons. There's no greater joy than seeing students learn, grow, and apply their skills to real-world problems. I was proud to have played a part in shaping their technical skills and fostering a sense of innovation and creativity.

## Achieving Milestones

Our hard work and dedication paid off when we achieved Tier-1 status in the Google Cloud Campaign and Tier-2 status in the Gen AI Challenge. These milestones were a testament to the team's efforts and a reflection of our commitment to excellence.

## A Journey of Growth and Learning

Looking back, my journey with GDSC has been an incredible ride. I've grown not only as a technologist but also as a leader and a mentor. I've learned the importance of teamwork, communication, and perseverance. I'm grateful for the opportunities I've had and the people I've met along the way.
